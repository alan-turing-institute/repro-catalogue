## Installation

The package is available on PyPI and requires Python 3 to use:

```bash
pip install repro-catalogue
```

## Prerequisites

**Data and code**

To use the tool, we assume you already have a project with some analysis code ready to run on your data. Your project structure might look something like this:

```
├── data_dir/
│   ├── my_data.csv
├── code_dir/
│   ├── my_analysis.py
├── results_dir/
```

**Git**

A pre-requisite for using `catalogue` is that the directory with the analysis code is a git repository. [Git](https://git-scm.com) is a really useful tool for version control (GitHub sits on top of git).

**Command line**

The tool has a command line interface so you will need to open something like Terminal in macOS or Command Prompt in Windows to use it.

Throughout, the tool will require you to provide paths to directories and files. Note that the directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux and macOS it may look like `data_dir/my_data.csv`, whereas on Windows it will be `data_dir\my_data.csv` (i.e., use `\` instead of `/`).
