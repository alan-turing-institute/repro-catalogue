## Commands and usage



### Catalogue overview

The `catalogue` tool comes with three commands (`engage`, `disengage`, `compare`) which should be run consecutively:

```
USAGE
  catalogue [-h] <command> [<arg1>] ... [<argN>]

ARGUMENTS
  <command>       The command to execute
  <arg>           The arguments of the command

GLOBAL OPTIONS
  -h (--help)     Display help message.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS
  engage          Run before an analysis. Saves hashes of `input_data` and `code`.
  disengage       Run after an analysis. Check `input_data` and `code` hashes now
                  are the same as at `engage`. Hash `output_data` and save all
                  hashes to a `TIMESTAMP.json` file.
  compare         Compare hashes.
```

Note that all arguments have default values which will be used if they are not provided. To see these use:

```{bash}
catalogue <command> -h
```

### Available commands

#### engage

This command is run before an analysis is conducted:

```{bash}
catalogue engage --input_data <data directory> --code <code directory>
```

Replace `<data directory>` and `<code directory>` with the path to the data and code directories. In practice, this might look something like this:

```{bash}
catalogue engage --input_data data_dir --code code_dir
```

This will do a series of things. First it will check that the git working tree in our code folder is clean. It gives users a choice:

```
Working directory contains uncommitted changes.
Do you want to stage and commit all changes? (y/[n])
```

If we choose to proceed, `catalogue` will stage and commit all changes in the code directory. Next it will create a temporary file `.lock` in json format:

```json
//catalogue_results/.lock
{
"timestamp" : {
    "engage": "<timestamp (of catalogue engage)>"
  },
"input_data": {
     "<data directory>" : "<hash of directory>"
   },
"code" : {
     "<code directory>": "<latest git commit hash>"
     }
}
```

Once catalogue is engaged, you can run your analysis.

#### disengage

The `disengage` command is run **immediately after finishing an analysis** to version the results.

For example, my analysis is done by running my code as an executable file in command prompt. Once I have finished running this code, I proceed to the disengage stage:

```{bash}
catalogue disengage \
  --input_data <data directory> \
  --code <code directory> \
  --output_data <results directory>
```

Replace all `<...>` with a path to the directory described. In practice, the command might look something like this:

```{bash}
catalogue disengage --input_data data_dir --code code_dir --output_data results_dir
```

Running this command checks that the `input_data` and `code` hashes match the hashes in the `.lock` file (created during `engage`). If they do, it will take hashes of the files in `output_data` and produce the following file in a `catalogue_results` directory:

```json
// catalogue_results/<TIMESTAMP>.json
{
"timestamp" : {
     "engage": "<timestamp (of .lock)>",
     "disengage": "<timestamp (new)>"
   },
"input_data": {
     "<data directory>": "<hash of directory>"
   },
"output_data": {
       "<results directory>":{
           "<output file 1>": "<hash of file>",
           "<output file 2>": "<hash of file>",
           ...
           }
     },
"code" : {
     "<code directory>": "<git commit hash>"
     }
}
```

#### compare

The `compare` command can be used to compare two catalogue output files against each other:

```{bash}
catalogue compare <TIMESTAMP1>.json <TIMESTAMP2>.json
```
The arguments should be the paths to the two files to be compared. For example, I might want to compare results produced on different days to check nothing has changed in this period:

```{bash}
catalogue compare catalogue_results/200510-120000.json catalogue_results/200514-170500.json
```

If the hashes in the files are the same, this means the same analysis was run on the same data with the same outputs both times. In that case, `catalogue` will output something like:

```{bash}
results differ in 1 places:
=============================
timestamp

results matched in 3 places:
==============================
input_data
code
output_data

results could not be compared in 0 places:
============================================
```

If only one file is provided to the `compare` command, then the hashes in the file are compared with hashes of the current state of the working directory. In that case, it is possible to also specify paths to the `input_data`, `code` and `output_data` (otherwise the default values are used).

### Optional arguments

#### --csv

It is possible to save the outputs from `disengage` to a csv rather than a json file. For this, use the `--csv` flag followed by the name of the file to save results to. Each new run will be appended as a new line to the csv file. For example:

```{bash}
catalogue disengage --input_data data_dir --code code_dir --output_data results_dir --csv hashes.csv
```

The `compare` command can then also be used with a `--csv` flag. In that case, one would provide the two timestamps to compare (these must exist in the csv file for the command to work):

```{bash}
catalogue compare 200510-120000 200514-170500 --csv hashes.csv
```

It is possible to provide just one timestamp instead of two and this will be compared against the state of the current working directory.

#### --catalogue_results

By default, all files created by `catalogue` are saved in a `catalogue_results` directory. It is possible to change this by using the optional `--catalogue_results` flag. For exmaple:

```{bash}
catalogue engage --input_data data_dir --code code_dir --catalogue_results versioning_files
```

Note that if you change the default `--catalogue_results` directory, you have to use this flag in each subsequent command. Also, this directory cannot be the same as the `--code` directory.
